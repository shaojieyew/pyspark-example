An amazing place. I really enjoy my time in this park. You can spend 2 hours easily. My favorite part is hell museum. I am amazed, such a beautiful place and free for public. Thanks Singapore.
Haw Par Villa, Even though called a theme park, is not your regular theme park. there are no rides or as such. but it gives you a unique experience nonetheless. there are Statue/visual Interpretations of Chinese folklore which are really interesting and fun to read. there's a path called Courts of Hell, which is really intriguing as it shows various levels of hells (like Dante's inferno) but from a Chinese folklore point of view. they also have an outpost showing other religions' point of view on Hell. Overall an amazing place to visit and spend time especially for people like me who are always interested in folklore and mythological stories.
Haw Par Villa is a nice place to visit. Something different... You got to see it for yourself.
Educational and scenic. It is a good place to visit while in Singapore to see some of the old stories brought to life in statue form. It is also good to learn the history on the family behind Tiger Balm and the gardens they brought to the public.
